README - developer Notes - Names, Labels, Namespaces, NS Prefix

10/2016 - moved all responsibility for accessing the TL Model out of ModelObjects into Nodes.
		Effectively making the Nodes act as Controllers and the TL Objects are the Model.

Usage
	Name
		Facets = the name of an element when assigned the facet as a type. Presented in the Name column
	Label
		Facets = the type of facet presented in Role column
	
	LibraryTablePoster
			item.setText(0, n.getName());
			item.setText(1, cn.getLabel());
	LibraryTreeLabelProvider
			label = n.getNavigatorName();
				Contextual Facets - getName()

Methods
	getTLModelObject() - strongly typed to return the specific TL class associated with the node.
	getName() - relies upon getTLModelObject()
			Specialized for use LocalName or Name depending on the underlying TL object (model)
