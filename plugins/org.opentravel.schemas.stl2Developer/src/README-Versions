README - developer Notes - Versions

VersionNode
 * Version nodes are used in the Versions aggregate to isolate actual component nodes from their parent library. 
  * For libraries that are part of a chain, all links to component nodes will be through a version node. 
  * For the non-version aggregate nodes, the links are directly to the most current component node.

 Constructor only called by LibraryChainNode.add(componentNode) IFF node's parent is not a version node
 after creating a version node (if needed) the node is added to complex or simple aggregate
 
 ** Assumption - there should be only one version node for all minor versions of an object in a chain
	Question - what should parent be for older versions?
