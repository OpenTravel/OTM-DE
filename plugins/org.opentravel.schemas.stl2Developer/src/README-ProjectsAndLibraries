README - developer Notes - libraries and projects

Libraries may be open in more than one project.

MVC - should be followed (but is not always)
	Model = The model directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

	View = A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

	Controller = The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

To test to see if running under the workbench:
		// Make sure this is running from the workbench before starting wizard.
		if (!OtmRegistry.getMainWindow().hasDisplay())
			return;

Note: wizards can not be created when headless ... JFace throws NPE			


Remove:
	called by CloseLibrariesHandler and RemoveLibrariesAction(Obsolete)
	1. Expand user selection(s) in the passed collection
	2. LibraryNode.close() each effected library	

	GUI Behaviors
		1. When any library in a chain is removed the entire chain is removed.
		
	Questions:
		LCN has close() method. Why not use that?
		Should LCN save the containing project? I don't think so, that is controller behavior.
Tests
	LibraryNodeTests
	DefaultLibraryController_Tests
	
TODO:
	Try to make an interface for Library and LibraryChainNode
