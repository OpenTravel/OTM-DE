README - developer Notes - libraries and projects

Libraries may be open in more than one project.

MVC - should be followed (but is not always)
	Model = The model directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

	View = A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

	Controller = The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

To test to see if running under the workbench:
		// Make sure this is running from the workbench before starting wizard.
		if (!OtmRegistry.getMainWindow().hasDisplay())
			return;

Note: wizards can not be created when headless ... JFace throws NPE			

Libraries in Multiple Projects
	There are separate classes for each library. (see test assertion in DefaultLibraryController_Tests)
	Each library has its own navigation nodes
	All libraries SHARE component nodes (I think...not sure what exactly are shared.)
		LibraryNode.generateLibrary() uses the identity listener on the TL object to get the node. (Not for service or resources)
		

Remove:
	called by CloseLibrariesHandler and RemoveLibrariesAction(Obsolete)
	1. Expand user selection(s) in the passed collection
	2. LibraryNode.close() each effected library	
		a. if the library is open in a different project, the make sure the parent of all named types is to that different library.

	GUI Behaviors
		1. When any library in a chain is removed the entire chain is removed.
		
	Questions:
		LCN has close() method. Why not use that?
		Should LCN save the containing project? I don't think so, that is controller behavior.
Tests
	LibraryNodeTests
	DefaultLibraryController_Tests
	
TODO:
	Try to make an interface for Library and LibraryChainNode
