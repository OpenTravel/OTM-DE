README - developer Notes - Resources

Events
	Resources use the tlObj events to signal changes that impact other fields. for example, a ResourceDependencyListener is placed onto ParameterGroups and individual parameters to catch changes that impact the paths for action requests that use that parameter group.

Examples
	Computed on the fly from data in the action contained in the example class.
	
Node Relations and identity
	Except for parent/child relationships, all relationships are maintainied in the TL Model Elements. This requires using the listners to get the node associated to a relationship. 
		For example, to act on the parameter group associated with a request:
			((ParamGroup)getNode(tlObj.getParamGroup().getListeners())).removeListeners(this);
		To get a node from a listener:
			((ResourceDependencyListener) listener).getNode();
