Resources
	Abstract Resource = no examples, no resource, reference facet?, not first class?
			x - No Base Path allowed
			x - Not 1st class
			x - No Business Object
			x -- I disabled the gui widgets, what if the data is invalid? Added remove button.
		Actions - ? must it always be common for abstract?
		ActionRequest - what does it mean to have a base request?
		x - ActionResponse - no change
	
	Action - handle Common behavior
	Parent Resource - Path Template is invalid because it has parameters
	Action Facet - 	Sometimes an error (validation error) is shown, but if you select optional the none it will go away
	change resource base path has to change all the RQ/RS paths
	Path Template on RQ wrong whenever a parent resource
	
	x - Action Facet - increment repeat count by 1
	x - Action Facet - When should Reference Facet be active?
	x - Action Facet - ReferenceType must be NONE for abstract resources
	x - NOT Done - triggered by events -- Example update - move to base of controller so that it runs whenever anything is touched.
	x - Request - missing inherited Action Facet
	x - Response - missing inherited Action Facet
	x - Initial Resource creation - request path template does not include parameter
	x - Wizard needs to allow no selection. Resource Command Handler - dialog before wizard
	x - Change location on Parameter - has to change the path template where that parameter is used.

General - High Priority
	Deleted - the deleted is both in the label and in the decoration
		- should NEVER see deleted decoration : what is wrong and how to repeat?
	ReplaceWhereUsed - with multiple selections. Works sometimes then failed to work.
	On Library/Project close - clear effected contents of example and graphical views
	Resource Remove Object button - make into a 3 column format
