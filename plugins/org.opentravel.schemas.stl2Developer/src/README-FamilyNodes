README - developer Notes - FamilyNodes

July 21, 2016 dmh

Removing FamilyNodes from the application. After discussion with 2 modeling teams the decision was to removed the family hierarchy.

Ultimatly, they would like to have them but under thier control.

This looks at how to remove them and considers if it would be better to keep most of the logic or to create from new when modeler-controlled families are implemented.

Assumption - family logic should implement SOC better and use handlers. The current code puts most/all family logic in Node and other calling classes.

-----------------

Constructors
	Used in 
		Node.addChildToFamily() -- deprecated and unused. Removed from Node class.
		Node.linkChild(Node, Boolean) - used a lot
		AggregateFamilyNode constructor
			AggregateNode.add()
			
	Should be able to prevent FamilyNode/AggregateFamilyNode construction by bypassing code in two spots: linkChild and add.
	
	Once that is done:
	1. Test in GUI - commenting out the two areas seems to work OK. Opens libraries and add new simple OK.
	2. Fix all the junits that complain about families
	3. Remove family from node fields are fix all resulting errors.
